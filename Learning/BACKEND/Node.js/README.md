### What Is Node.js
- Node. js is a free `open-sourced`, `cross-platform` Javascript `run-time environment`.
T- hat lets developers write command line
tools and server-side scripts outside of a
browser.

#### Open-source

- Node.js has a huge community of
collaborators who work consistently on
keeping Node.js feature-rich and up-to-date.

#### Cross-platform

- Node.js code can run on any operating
system like: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
#### Runtime environment
- Node.js is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 engine which allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.

#### Why Should You Use Node.js?
+ **Javascript:** Nodes s built on top of the JavaScript programming language, which means that f you already
know JavaScript, you can easily learn Node. js. This makes it an attractive option for web developers who want
to use a familiar language on both the front-end and back-end.
+ **Scalability:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking /0 model which makes it highly scalable. It can handle
large volumes of traffic with ease, making it ideal for applications that need to handle a high volume of
requests.
+ **Performance:** Nodes is known for its speed and performance. Because it runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, it
can execute code very quickly, making it a great choice for real-time applications.
+ **Large ecosystem:** Node js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source
packages and modules that can be easily installed using npm (Node Package Manager). This makes it easy to
find pre-existing solutions to common problems and speeds up development time.
+ **Cross-platform:** Nodes can run on multiple operating systems including Windows, mac0S, and Linux, making
it a versatile choice for developers working across different platforms.
+ **Overall,** Node js is a powerful tool that offers many benefits to developers, particularly those working on real-
time web applications or projects that require scalability and performance.
